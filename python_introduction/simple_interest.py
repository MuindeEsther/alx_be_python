# Define three variables in this file:
# principal, rate, and time.
P = 1000  # The initial amount of money
R = 0.05         # The annual interest rate (in percentage)
T = 3         # The time the money is invested for (in years)

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula:
# interest = (principal * rate * time)
interest = (P * R * T)
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
