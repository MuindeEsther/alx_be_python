# Define three variables in this file:
# principal, rate, and time.
principal = 1000  # The initial amount of money
rate = 0.05         # The annual interest rate (in percentage)
time = 3         # The time the money is invested for (in years)

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula:
# Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time)
interest = principal * rate * time
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
